                    <p>Jyoti, derived from the Hindi meaning of "divine light," is the cornerstone of fine Indian dining in the New York tri-state area. What started out as a local pasttime making dishes for owner Aman Banerjee quickly turned into opening his own restaurant after the immense praise received from his customers. By 1994, the restaurant officially opened to the public in the heart of Wayne, New Jersey, allowing people around the New York City area to have easy access to explore the delicious flavors Jyoti offers.</p>

                    <p>Jyoti is an Indian restaurant known for its premiere assortment of foods from samosas and raita, but is much more than just that. The restaurant offers an approach to select from non-contemporary dishes such as lamb curry, shrimp bhindi, and even sham swera, among others. The bar is filled with an assortment of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages as well to celebrate the end of the work week, or to enjoy the big game with your friends on our televisions. In addition to the luxury cuisine, creating appetizing options for an array of consumers with different tastes and preferences, Jyoti is also known for its banquet hall. Events from Sweet 16's to receptions and other festivities can be held in our massive banquet hall. It's a match made in heaven with fine Indian dining and your event!

                        Upon entering the restaurant, I was fascinated by the diverse aromas of spices. The meal turned out to be a great experience for me and my family. Would highly recommend Jyoti as the premiere restaurant for Indian dining!

                        I hosted a surprise graduate party for my friend at Jyoti. The event in their banquet hall was exemplary, and everyone praised the foods offered. The appetizers in particular were a hit, and overall, the night was amazing.

                        Had my first date here at Jyoti. Both of us were taken care of nicely, and the taste of Jyoti's food brought back childhood nostalgia for eating Punjabi food. This is the perfect restaurant to enjoy Indian food and be treated with the utmost care. I am definitely coming back again!

                        Our team and I catered a lunch from Jyoti. None of us tasted Indian cuisine before, and we were unsure of trying. All of us loved the different meat and seafood options provided. Additionally, the staff member executing our catering order displayed effective communication skills.
