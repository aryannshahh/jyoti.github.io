                <h1><u>Banquet Hall Information</u></h1>
                    <p>Jyoti welcomes you the opportunity to celebrate your momentous occasion in our massive banquet hall. No matter if it's an event of just 40 or as many as 150 people, Jyoti can make your night a memorable one cherished for life. Jyoti welcomes outside DJs and even food from another restaurant to be placed in the banquet hall. Additionally, you are more than welcome to bring your own drinks, but our bar features an assortment of alcohol from standard to sophisticated liquor products. An open bar can be accommodated as well with just soda products.</p>

                    <p>Note that because of high demand, slots fill up easily. Jyoti recommends you book at least a month in advance to host your event in the banquet hall. Nevertheless, we ensure your event will be spectacular given that silverware and other fine china, as well as chairs and tables, among other standard items held in a banquet hall, are already provided for your use. Rent our indoor space for your next private event today!</p>
